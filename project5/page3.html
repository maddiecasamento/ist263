          <p>On March 17th, 1944 volcano Mount Vesuvius erupted destroying almost all of Pompeii. It buried 
            the city under a layer of volcanic ash, practically freezing the city until its rediscovery. Pompeii is now 
            used as an archaeological site where you can view the homes of those who passes in the Eruption along 
            with many other artifacts found. The volcano is still active but has not erupted since 1944.</p>

          <p>The Colosseum began construction in AD 70-72, and was completed in AD 80. At the time, it was 
            used for entertainment such as plays of famous battles. Over time, the Colosseum has been damaged 
            because of fires, and earthquakes. Something cool about the Colosseum is that it had underground 
            tunnels that were built like a maze, that were concealed beneath the Colosseum. </p>

            <p>The Vatican, built in 1929, is an independent city-state also known as Vatican City. It takes place 
              within the city of Rome and is also the smallest independent state in the world. It serves as a spiritual 
              part of the Roman Catholic Church. When entering certain parts of the Vatican you are not aloud to take
              pictures or talk. Your shoulders and knees also have to remain covered. Every Sunday, the Pope looks 
              out his window over Saint Peter’s square and does a blessing for tourists.</p>
