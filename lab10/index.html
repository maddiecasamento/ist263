            <p>
            My name is Maddie Casamento. I am currently undecided in the iSchool, but looking to be a Innovation Society and Technology major with a concentration in either retail studies or web design. I also have a design minor in Newhouse. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I am <strong>extremely</strong> interested in social media and the way it works. I would say I am a very communicative person, and it tends to be one of my best traits. I also did a lot of community service throughout high school. Outside of work I love to hang out with friends, spend time outside, or play sports. My favorite TV show is Survivor. 
            </p>
